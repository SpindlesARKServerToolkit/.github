# What is this?
This is a Work in Progress server manager utility for ARK: Survival Evolved designed to be cross-platform. 
It is planned to be easy to use and share some similarities to [arkmanager/ark-server-tools](https://github.com/arkmanager/ark-server-tools) but the core system and configuration will definitely be different.

# Wheres the code?
The code is currently closed source as it is the very start, once it is ready it will no longer be closed source, but will be under AGPL v3.
